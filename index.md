My current project examines ethnoracial categorization in the Domininican Republic. Given the absence of ethnoracial categories on the Domininican national census, in contrast to other countries in the region, I ask: how and why the interaction of census officials, local activists, and representatives of international organizations did not lead to the addition of race or color questions on the Dominican census?
